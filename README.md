## About a project

Create games with Rust-based [Fyrox Game Engine](https://fyrox.rs) without coding in Rust.

### [Fyrox / C# ‚§¥](https://kkolyan.github.io/fyrox_lite/fyrox_cs/index.html)

Prebuilt [Fyrox editor](https://fyrox-book.github.io/beginning/editor_overview.html) imbued
with [C#](https://learnxinyminutes.com/csharp/) scripting support.

* Requires [.Net 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)
  for development.
* Run and compile game from either Fyrox Editor, any IDE (with debug support) or command line.
* Optional [JB Rider plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/27613-fyroxlite?noRedirect=true).

### [Fyrox / Lua ‚§¥](https://kkolyan.github.io/fyrox_lite/fyrox_lua/index.html)

Prebuilt [Fyrox editor](https://fyrox-book.github.io/beginning/editor_overview.html) imbued
with [Lua](https://learnxinyminutes.com/lua/) scripting support.

* No additional SDKs required.
* Run game from either Fyrox Editor or command line.

## Current state

* It works (see [Examples](#examples))
* The [subset of supported Fyrox API](https://kkolyan.github.io/fyrox_lite/fyrox_cs/scripting_api.html) is pretty
  limited.
* It probably lacks polishing
* Prebuilt binaries temporary unavailable (due to high pace of development)

## Supported platforms

| Platform    | Edit scripts & scenes | Lua: Play | C#: Play |
|-------------|-----------------------|-----------|----------|

* ‚úÖ Supported
* üü° Relatively easy to support; likely if requested
* üü† Feasible but more complex; likely if broadly requested
* üî¥ Possible with significant effort; likely if widely requested
* ‚ùå No plans to support

## Examples

There is a simple game that written in different scripting languages to demonstrate the part of Fyrox API currently
exposed to scripting languages.

* [in Fyrox / C#](https://github.com/kkolyan/fyrox_lite/blob/main/showcase/guards_cs)
* [in Fyrox / Lua](https://github.com/kkolyan/fyrox_lite/blob/main/showcase/guards_lua)
* [in Fyrox / Rust (vanilla)](https://github.com/kkolyan/fyrox_lite/blob/main/showcase/guards_vanilla)

## Credits

* Special thanks to [Dmitry Stepanov](https://github.com/mrDIMAS), author of Fyrox, and
  other [Fyrox](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/) Contributors for such a powerful and inspiring foundation.
* Gratefully acknowledge the Godot Engine contributors for its modular design and permissive license, which made it
  possible
  to [incorporate portions of its C# code into this project](https://github.com/kkolyan/fyrox_lite/tree/main/langs/cs/fyrox-lite-sln/fyrox_lite_cs_netcore/src/FromGodot).
